# Deformable-FlowNet2 

This is an adaption of the FlowNet2 code by NVIDIA. We adapted the FlowNet2 code to incorporate Deformable Convolutions, and conducted ablation studies.

This project was for the Deep Learning course at Columbia, Spring 2019. My partners were Nicholas Sparks and Jacob Portes.
